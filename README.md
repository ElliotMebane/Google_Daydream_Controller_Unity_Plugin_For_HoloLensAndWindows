This is a sample project implementing the Bluetooth LE Google Daydream handheld controller plugin in Unity for connecting a Daydream controller with Windows HoloLens and Windows 10 PCs.  
  
This is the Lite version of the plugin. Some features time-out after a couple of minutes.  
  
The plugin is available on the Unity Asset store at these links:

There are several applications I recommend for testing your HRM device's BLE capabilities:  
- Android/iOS â€“ nRF Connect from Nordic Semiconductor:
